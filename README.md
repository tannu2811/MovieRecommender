# MovieRecommender
It is a movie recommender system which is built using Python and its libraries. I have filtered out that movies which very people have rated that helps in reducing false results.
On the basis of correlation this recommender system recommends movies. It tells how closely one movie is related to other. And eventually how 
likely a person is going to love other movies based on the movies he watched.
